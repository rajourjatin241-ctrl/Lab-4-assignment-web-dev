How It Works
- Questions & Answers Stored in an Array
- Each question is an object with two properties:
- question: the text shown to the user.
- answer: the correct answer (stored in lowercase for easy comparison).
- Example:
{ question: "What is the capital of France?", answer: "paris" }
- Loop Through Questions
- A for loop iterates through the array of questions one by one.
- For each question, the program uses prompt() to ask the user for input.
- Process User Input
- The user’s response is normalized with:
- .toLowerCase() → makes the answer case-insensitive.
- .trim() → removes extra spaces before/after the input.
- This ensures " Paris " and "paris" are treated the same.
- Check Answer
- The program compares the processed input with the stored correct answer.
- If correct → shows alert("Correct!").
- If wrong → shows alert(" Wrong! The correct answer is: ...").
- Track Score
- A variable score starts at 0.
- Each correct answer increases the score by 1.
